# X-ray-Abnormality-Detection
This project was built to classify an upper limb x-ray as normal or abnormal.  The image classification was implemented using a Convolutional Neural Network built in Pytorch and GRADcam for highlighting of the abnormality.  

## Data

The image data comes from the MURA 1.1 dataset from Stanford University School of Medicine. MURA is a dataset of musculoskeletal radiographs consisting of 14,863 studies from 12,173 patients, with a total of 40,561 multi-view radiographic images. Each belongs to one of seven standard upper extremity radiographic study types: elbow, finger, forearm, hand, humerus, shoulder, and wrist. Each study was manually labeled as normal or abnormal by board-certified radiologists from the Stanford Hospital at the time of clinical radiographic interpretation in the diagnostic radiology environment between 2001 and 2012.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
